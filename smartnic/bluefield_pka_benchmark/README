PKA (Public-key Accelerator) can only be used in Mellanox BlueField.
PKA library and openssl is necessery.

To build and install pka library into SmartNIC. Please refer <bluefield software package>/pkalib-1.0/README.

benchmark_example evaluate PKA performance. It is similar with benchmark provided by BlueField software package, located in pkalib-1.0/tests/.

openssl_example measure embedded ARM core to perform Public key operation.

note: If you want to evaluate benchmark with multiple process, you should set PKA_RING_CNT as 2 or 1.
      BlueField SmartNIC has only 4 I/O block (= 4 window RAMs), where each is partitioned into 4 rings.
      Each I/O block cannot be shared between processes, so you cannot scale out processes exceeding 4.
