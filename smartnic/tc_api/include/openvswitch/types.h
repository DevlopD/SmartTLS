/* These types help with a few funny situations:
 *
 *   - The Ethernet header is 14 bytes long, which misaligns everything after
 *     that.  One can put 2 "shim" bytes before the Ethernet header, but this
 *     helps only if there is exactly one Ethernet header.  If there are two,
 *     as with GRE and VXLAN (and if the inner header doesn't use this
 *     trick--GRE and VXLAN don't) then you have the choice of aligning the
 *     inner data or the outer data.  So it seems better to treat 32-bit fields
 *     in protocol headers as aligned only on 16-bit boundaries.
 *
 *   - ARP headers contain misaligned 32-bit fields.
 *
 *   - Netlink and OpenFlow contain 64-bit values that are only guaranteed to
 *     be aligned on 32-bit boundaries.
 *
 * lib/unaligned.h has helper functions for accessing these. */
