/* Tunnel option data, plus metadata to aid in their interpretation.
 *
 * The option data exists in two forms and is interpreted differently depending
 * on whether FLOW_TNL_F_UDPIF is set in struct flow_tnl flags:
 *
 * When FLOW_TNL_F_UDPIF is set, the tunnel metadata is in "userspace datapath
 * format". This is typically used for fast-path packet processing to avoid
 * the cost of translating options and in situations where we need to maintain
 * tunnel metadata exactly as it came in. In this case 'opts.gnv' is raw
 * packet data from the tunnel header and 'present.len' indicates the length
 * of the data stored there. In these situations, 'tab' is NULL.
 *
 * In all other cases, we are doing flow-based processing (such as during
 * upcalls). FLOW_TNL_F_UDPIF is not set and options are reordered into
 * pre-allocated locations. 'present.map' is indexed by type, that is, by the
 * <i> in TUN_METADATA<i>, so that e.g. TUN_METADATA5 is present if
 * 'present.map & (1ULL << 5)' is nonzero. The actual data for TUN_METADATA5,
 * if present, might be anywhere in 'opts.u8' (not necessarily even contiguous),
 * and finding it requires referring to 'tab', if set, or the global metadata
 * table. */
